    <div class="project-description">
    Qubit is a large, multi-continental company with offices around the world. Having employees in all corners of the globe, often working remotely, makes it hard to spread company news quickly and easily to all employees. Often remote workers and distant offices feel left out from company culture and news. We were tasked with finding a solution to this problem. Read more about my thinking behind this issue on <a href="https://medium.com/@simonrayrayamor"> my blog</a>.

<div class="project" id="image-2-3"></div>

     <div class="project-comment">The solution was an Internal communications portal, to be opened up every new tab. This allows the news to be viewed easily and often, in a location that people were already visiting. Priority news is front and center of the design, making sure no employ misses out on the big announcements. To help with adoption we added in time zones of all Qubit offices are displayed across the bottom of the screen to help people when booking in meetings across regions of the globe, a personalized welcome message, and beautiful background imagery pulled from Google chromecast.</div>

     <div class="project" id="image-2-4"></div>

      <div class="project-comment">A Qubit newsfeed is updated by admins from every department all around the world. This means Qubti employees gain a holistic vision of company activity. News about events, new starters, deals won and much more appears here. To help with adoption we added Useful and commonly used links at the top of the page. These are links that employees mauy need on a daily basis to access other qubit pages and information. </div>


      <div class="project" id="image-2-2"></div>
      <div class="project-comment">As the portal holds sensitive information we had to make sure only Qubit employees can gain access. To do this we used google single sign on, only people with a qubit email address can log on and see Qubit news.</div>

          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>

     <div class="project-comment">As the portal opens up in a new tab, employees could accidently reveal confidential information when presenting to clients using a company laptop. We added a privacy switch that removes all potentially sensitive material from the screen so employees can use their laptops in public and with clients, without worrying about showing confidential information.  </div>

  <div class="project-comment">Employees can access a mobile version of the portal via a URL, allowing them to keep up to date with company activity while on the road.
